Lexicographical Order
____________________________________________________________________


Lexicographical Order, also known as alphabetic or dictionary order, orders characters as follows: 
For example, ball < cat, dog < dorm, Happy < happy, Zoo < ball.











Comparing Lexicographical Order of Strings in Java:


	    The Java String class provides the .compareTo () method in order to lexicographically compare Strings. It is used like this "apple".compareTo ("banana").
	
	    The return of this method is an int which can be interpreted as follows:

			- returns < 0 then the String calling the method is lexicographically first (comes first in a dictionary)

			- returns == 0 then the two strings are lexicographically equivalent
	
			- returns > 0 then the parameter passed to the compareTo method is lexicographically first.
